Service             is defined as any php object that is provides functionality
                    in a given context. (context meaning any group of objects 
                    that has access to the DIContainer)

DependencyBuilder   is an object specifically designed to build a specific 
                    service. It has all the knowledge of creatation and 
                    configuration.

Dependency          is an object that holds the service and service builder. 
                    It will build the service only when it is requested and 
                    controls if a single or multiple instances of the service 
                    are created.

Settings            A list of application and package settings. The dependency 
                    manager collects parameters out of the settings and adds 
                    them to the service builder.

DIContainer         the dependency injection container. This holds a list of 
                    dependency objects plus configuration settings.

DIBuilder           The dependency injection builder is responsible for create
                    and configurating the container
