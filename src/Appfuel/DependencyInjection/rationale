Service             is defined as any php object that is provides functionality
                    in a given context. (context meaning any group of objects 
                    that has access to the DIContainer)

ServiceBuilder      is an object specifically designed to build a specific 
                    service. It has all the knowledge of creatation and 
                    configuration. Configuration settings are stored in a 
                    ArrayDataInterface. The Loadable Dependency picks out
                    the settings from the container and adds them to the 
                    builder.

Dependency          Holds a service. This is used by the DIContainer, to 
                    determine if the service is available and to retrieve the
                    service

LoadableDependency  A dependency that holds a service builder and lazy loads the
                    service when needed

DIContainer         the dependency injection container. This holds a list of 
                    dependency objects (either Dependency or LoadableDependency)
                    it also holds a list of parameters. The DIContainer extends
                    the ArrayDataInterface, all parameters are accessed using 
                    the ArrayDataInterface and all services use getService.

DIBuilder           The dependency injection builder is responsible for create
                    and configurating the container.
