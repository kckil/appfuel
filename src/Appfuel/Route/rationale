RouteSpec           A value object used to hold details about a particular 
                    route. Details include:
                    key         unique string used to identify the route 
                    pattern     regular expression used to match a route in an
                                http uri path
                    uri-group   used to indicate this route should be add to 
                                a collection of routes that match a particular
                                part of a uri path. Note: the resulting uri 
                                path after the group match has the part of the
                                path that matched removed so that you don't have
                                to repeatedly match it
                    uri-params  list of parameter that correspond to the uri 
                                path parameters that we captured in the regex
                                along with any default values. These params 
                                server two purposes. One, urls will be 
                                generated using this list. Two, it helps 
                                organize regex captures so you don't have to use
                                ugly (?P<name>), also applying default values
